# Explanation

Briefly describe your process:

- What tools and libraries did you use?
- How did you decide how to extract and reinsert text?
- What worked well? What was frustrating?
- If you had another day to improve this, what would you try?

Optional:
- Did you fine-tune or explore improving the model output in any way?
- Did you attempt post-OCR correction? If so, how?
- What metric(s) did you use to evaluate the output quality (if any)?
